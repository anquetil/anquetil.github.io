_128 Units is a work in progress! I have been working on it to learn React and build & launch a full product. This page was last updated July 2nd, 2018._

### Idea
Going through college, I've always wanted a tool to plan my classes, assess different possible major/minor combinations, and plan my electives! I couldn't find one, so I decided to build it!

### Implementation
First, I built [scraping scripts](https://github.com/anquetil/usc-catalogue-scraper) in Node.js to browse through the USC catalogue and pull all 11,500+ courses, their descriptions, and all major/minors/programs. These gave me all the data I could put on the website. I had to clean some of the data because it was oddly formatted & inconsistent on the catalogue website.

I then built the course catalogue page, instantly searching through all courses using with the help of [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized). Then, I built the Course Plan page with [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd)'s drag and drop functionality. Using both of these significantly accelerated the development, although I had to work out different compatibility issues.

### Future
I am still actively working on 128 Units and hoping to launch it by mid-August!
