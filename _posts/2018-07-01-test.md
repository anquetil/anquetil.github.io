# Bracket Creator
## Trying different things

### The Original Idea

Being a huge soccer fan and avid supporter of the French National Team, I'm always anticipating the next international tournament. Whether it be the Euro or the World Cup, I love assessing different possible brackets and making my personal predictions.

As my first solo programming project, in 2014, I created a simple Java program which allowed a user to input scores through the console and updated the group standings of the world cup. It allowed me to explore different scenarions through which teams could move past the group stage. More importantly however, it blended my passion for soccer with my new-found interest in coding.
