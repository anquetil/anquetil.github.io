It‚Äôs one of the most effective ways to get potential customers or employees or new opportunities in front of you. The ROI is unbounded. \nNo, your content marketing strategy isn‚Äôt going to achieve the same goal. No, you can‚Äôt just post feature and partnership updates. \nYou‚Äôve gotta share your ideas from the trenches, in hopes that they‚Äôll find the folks that resonate in ways you can‚Äôt even imagine ‚Äî and they will."

   "text": "A bit puzzled by the people who continue to insist that open channels without any gating or spam filtering would work just fine.\nWhen I mention there would be a lot of spam, they tell me I'm wrong or they would manually weed it out.\nWe tried that for the last year and it didn't work. Very few channel owners / moderators wanted to do the drudgery of cleaning up spammy casts. It's not fun or rewarding. And that's logical on their end!\nThe reason web2 doesn't have this problem:\n1. The successful companies like Meta or YouTube have *10s of thousands* of ops people moderating the platform; they also have massive data sets and AI models to help\n2. They are centralized. They can *delete* spammy accounts and there's no recourse.\n3. X / Twitter got rid of most of their ops people, so you see *a lot* more spam on there. Additionally, #hashtags on Twitter have been spammy for 10 years. Just look at the following link:\n"

   "text": "Playing with an idea:\nI don't think the parallel between AWS/Google Cloud and Ethereum/Solana/Base/[insert chain here] actually makes sense. Folks use the comparison to argue that \"users won't care what chain something is on,\" but developers will, and I think we can assume the lines between developer and consumer are blurring to the point where the number of people who care will rise exponentially. \nIn the \"prosumer\" world enabled by AI content, software, and business creation, protocols and chains become \"environments\" that people will work and play in. We're already seeing this thesis play out amongst crypto-natives, and chain abstraction won't make it go away because there will always be new opportunities and capabilities in new frontiers.\nPeople want to be native to a built environment. On the internet, branded software and protocols ‚Äì with their own values and culture ‚Äì are the foundations of those environments."

   "text": "\"The new channels are terrible.\"\n1. The old channels weren't working. So we opted to make a big, breaking change. Inevitably, some people were going to be upset. No risk, no reward.\n2. We're actively improving channels. See the summary cast below for what we've already improved and what's on our radar. \n3. Our next big project is onboarding new users directly to a channel so they have a Day 1 channel to cast in and a community of people.\n4. If your claim is \"no one likes the new channels and they didn't take user feedback into account\", see the second cast below for a slice of the network happy with the changes. Again, not claiming perfection, but let's start from a baseline that the changes worked for some users and did not work for others. And we're working to improve them for the people it didn't work for.\n6. If you're still frustrated with channels, feel free to reply to this cast with what's not working for you.\n"

   "text": "Why can't I request to join a channel?\n\nSee the points from the FAQ below, but basically we wanted to avoid creating yet another inbox for owners. Additionally, owners may not want to have people requesting to join. Your channel, your rules.\n\nAdditional thoughts \n\n1. Channels are not hashtags. We tried that version for the last year or so. Didn't work. With the new direction, they are communities run by individuals or small groups. They are opinionated. We think that's a good thing.\n\n2. One way to think of channels now is they are text-based Twitter Spaces‚Äîsome people on stage, but a large audience.\n\n3. Reminder: you can always cast in your home feed (goes to all of your followers) or create a new channel.\n\n4. There are already a bunch of tools like Cura from , /channel-kit from , or  from  to let channel owners opt in to have request to join flows. Or token gate with  or .\n\n5. We added a link in bio that works with frames to help make this easy."

   "text": "PSA about the new version of channels\n1. They're no longer single topics / hashtags. We tried hashtags for a year and they didn't work. There's no canonical /food channel anymore. Instead, there will be many smaller groups about a topic.\n2. The best way to think about the new version of channels ‚Äî a text-based Twitter Space. There's a group of people (members) \"on stage\" who can post new stuff in the channel, and a larger group in the \"audience\". However, anyone in the audience can reply and get discovered / invited to the channel. We've improved how replies work (and making it easy to invite from replies) in the last 24 hours.\n3. Casting in your home feed, i.e. no channel, will give you just as much distribution in the algo. We have not been boosting casts from channels you follow but people you don't follow for a while. The results were too inconsistent.\n4. Our next big focus will be onboarding new users directly to channels when joining Farcaster."

   "text": "\"I'm not a spammy, I'm a real person not a bot.\" or \"Just use proof of humanity to solve spam.\"\n1. Spam is relative: you might not find something spammy but another person might find it spammy.\n2. If you are casting in your home feed or to people who chose to follow you, then it's by definition not spammy\n3. If you are casting *at* someone else, then their opinion does matter. It's no different than walking up to someone on the street and trying to strike up a conversation with them.\n4. Fundamentally, spam is unwanted inbound that tries to get someone's attention (literally what spam email is).\n5. Humans can be spammy and bots can be not spammy.\n6. What proof of humanity does is limits how fast new accounts can get created, i.e. if you want to create 1000 accounts, you now have to get 1000 proof of humanity credentials. That's friction.\n7. However, if you have proof of humanity, you can still be spammy (and still hook your account up to ChatGPT, etc.)."

   "text": "The spam filtering dilemma\nSharing how we think about it so people can better understand:\n1. Most people will only use social networks if they are fun\n2. Casting something and getting dozens of spammy replies is not fun\n3. If you get enough spammy replies, you'll just stop using the app\n4. So, aggressively filtering for spam is necessary to keep your existing users happy\n5. However, this means some good new users will hit spam filters. Understatement: this is a bad user experience for those people. It would be great to not have this happen.\n6. But given the choice of who to make unhappy ‚Äî¬†an existing user who has invested a ton of time and energy into the network or a new user that is most likely to churn (top tier social networks lose 50% of users!), then you have to optimize for your existing users.\n7. So does that mean you don‚Äôt care about new users? No! It‚Äôs existential to have new users be able to join Farcaster and find people to connect with ‚Äî without being labeled as spam.\n1/2"

We have a no squatting policy for fnames and we allow ENS for a name that isn't governed by that policy.\n2. We never advertised channels as something you buy and own forever. Has been centralized and experimental since we allowed anyone to create a channel last December.\n3. I'm sympathetic to someone who is good faith trying to build a community, but that's not squatting.\n4. Squatting is squishy, know it when you see, not deterministic.\n5. Ultimately, squatters are massive negative externality on the network. It's parasitic, anti-social behavior."

The most common frustrations:\na. losing access to a favorite channel, esp. if you had a streak in it\nb. seeing your reply \"below the fold\"\nc. older casts in channels disappearing from personal profiles\nd. many channels not having clear instructions for joining\nSo what we're doing this week\n3. Continue to talk to users (mostly me) and pay attention to feedback\n4. We're considering some tweaks to how above / below the fold works for non-members, esp. if the original caster is following someone. We won't make any sudden changes here, fwiw\n5. Strongly considering adding back older casts in channels to profiles (with a label on the cast). The data is untouched at the protocol level, just hidden on Warpcast right now.\n6. Continue to get feedback from channel owners / mods / users / developers on making request to join a channel a primitive similar to invites. Again, no sudden changes."
