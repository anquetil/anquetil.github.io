		This website was built for Tara Baudry. Every day, you will see a new canvas.
		<br><br>
			You will see 4 things on it - the date, the name of a loved one, and a word that that person has used to describe you. All together, they combine to create a unique piece of art that no one has ever seen before.
		<br><br>
			I love you.
