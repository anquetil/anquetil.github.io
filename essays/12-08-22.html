<h2>DAO Career Playbooks</h2>

A difficulty (and probably a perk) of being a DAO participant / free agent in 2022 is there is absolutely no guidelines for how my work or career should look.
<br><br>
In a lot of other fields, some narratives (of varying truthfulness) exist - work at Google for two years then start a company, become excellent at product design, do x, y,z to make Partner in 10 years, make sure your work is visible to the CEO, have a recurring meeting with your manager's manager. In the rogue crypto world (going to exclude traditionally-structured crypto startups here), it's really not obvious what to do, because it's not clear what the world will look like. I don't know if there are great historic comparisons because the fundamental work _mode_ has changed; the closest thing might be the rise of creators and "indie" types with various streams of income (ex; Venkatesh Rao, Paul Millerd, Nat Eliason)
<br><br>
Some things obviously still apply, like developing good skills and relationships. But as a 24 year old that cares a lot about Nouns-type DAOs, what should I... do? Try to get paid full-time by just one? Participate a little bit in all? Get really good at just one thing for all these DAOs? Make content around them? Start my own DAO? I guess the question is more "how do I decide what to do?"
<br><br>
A lot of this is just my own struggles with indecision in my career. But having some narratives would still be nice :)
<br><br>
An additionall variable here is building wealth. In the late phase of the 2008-2022 bull market, it was kind of obvious when a startup was "Pre-IPO" - a lot of people knew you could join Coinbase/Slack in 2019, and if you were a senior engineer, you'd probably like $1M off of it. There are lots of mini "playbooks" like this in the existing corporate world.
<br><br>
In DAOs, what does that look like? Most Nouns contributor don't get paid in Nouns equity. A lot of DAO contributors getting paid _exclusively_ in equity probably immediately convert it to USDC to pay bills(unfortunately, this phenomenon probably further tanks the value of most DAO's tokens). So how do you balance those two?
<br><br>
Of course, the upside of all of this is I can craft my work and my life however I want, without being tied to one thing. But, the down side is I'm condemned to be free as Sartre would say - "We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does."
